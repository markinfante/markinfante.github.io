To those who do not know me, welcome. My name is Mark Infante and I am a self proclaimed *learning enthusiast*. 
I want to say first off, I am going to keep this short and sweet. This is my first blog post, on my first website, using my first semblance of frontend web technologies (no matter how small).
I want to give a big shoutout/thank you to Jonathan Mcglone, author of [this] (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) article and guide. 
As a backend developer with knowledge in Java, Python, Go, Ocaml, etc., who has literally never touched html or css, this page is actually groundbreaking for me.
Without this guide, I wouldn't have even known where to start.   
Anyways, the journey continues. Inevitably, I will have to edit this. So, see you a couple iterations down the road AND in the many posts to come!
